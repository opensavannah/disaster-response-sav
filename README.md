# disaster-response-sav

Inspired by civic tech volunteer responses to hurricanes Harvey and Irma,
the goal of the disaster-response-sj project is to engage with City of Savannah's
Office of Emergency Services to discuss how the 2019 CfA Fellowship team can contribute to
disaster response planning and execution in Coastal Georgia. 

## Plan

1. Gather information on existing system
2. Determine pain points or missing pieces of existing system
3. Look for existing tools to address #2

## Resources

_(will move this to its own page in a bit)_

### City of Savannah

  Agenda items 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 all relate to the flood response and future emergency management. Iâ€™d specifically recommend watching/listening to the City staff presentation and public comment (go to item 3.5 in the video index), or reading the staff memo for item 3.6.


See particularly Sec. 3.6 Memorandum; it's 130 pages total (!!) but the TL;DR is Appendix B and C.
